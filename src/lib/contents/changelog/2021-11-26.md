title: Deleted project & team names can be reclaimed
excerpt: When a project or team is deleted on Gitpod, we get rid of it completely so you can claim it again should you choose so.

You create a project, run some tests, then delete it. A week later, you miss working in ephemeral developer environments on Gitpod and decide to configure your project again.

Here's the good news for today: We actually let you do that now üòÖ!

When you delete a project, we now clean that up for good and properly remove it from the database. This lets you configure that same project again later.

The same also applies to teams where you are the only owner. If you delete such a team, we remove the team and its associated projects.

Please let us know what you think via Twitter [@gitpod](https://twitter.com/gitpod) or chat with us at https://www.gitpod.io/chat.
